Option A:
Use a different thread for each player.
Create a timer task whenever a player wants to start drinking and start the task immediately.
Pros:
Easier to do.

Cons:
Managing timer task creation and destruction has a significant over head.
At any time, if we have more than the maximum allowable limit of threads, then there maybe memory errors.
Option B:
Use a threadpool.
Pros:
There would be configuration overhead.
Cons:
Less management overhead for timer task creation and destruction

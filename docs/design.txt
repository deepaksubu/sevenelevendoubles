Initial Design: happy path

Client
waits for user input =>
add speed of dice rolls =>
add maxDrinks number of drinks =>
add player with drinking time =>
add one more player with drinking time =>
add third player with drinking time =>
start the game.


Game:
validate the data which comes from the client.
start the simulation

until finish
      preconditions
          the number of players <=
      player roll dice,
      decide roll type,
      decide next step based on roll type
           if winner
           pick a player to start drinking
                 if player is not beyond his quota,
                    if he is not drinking,
                    start drinking
                    else add to the drinking queue
           if loser,
           if no person drinking,
           pass to next player

Testing
Look at the invariants of the program. None of them should be violated during each step
0 < no of players <= MAX
1 < dice total <= 12
0 <= drinks per player <= MAX drinks
